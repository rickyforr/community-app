# Community App

A simple app to display housing information regarding Calgary communities.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `Given more time...`

Given more time I would have added redux and added data fetched from the api to the redux store instead of passing it down to the child components (could also use the context api to avoid passing props down multiple layers). Would have added custom redux middleware to handle http calls. This would help with scaling the application if needed. Would have also increased my test coverage of the components.
